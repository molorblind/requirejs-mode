{"name":"Requirejs-mode","tagline":"requireJS minor mode for emacs","body":"requirejs-mode\r\n==============\r\n\r\nrequireJS is a Backbone aware minor mode for emacs\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make writing modules for [requireJS](http://requirejs.org) easier and more\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIt is available on the [marmalade-repo](http://marmalade-repo.org), so if you use ELPA:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage-install requirejs-mode\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, make sure you put the `requirejs-mode.el` in your load path.\r\n\r\nThen in your `init.el` file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(require 'requirejs-mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you would like to automatically load requireJs mode when editing javascript, you can put the\r\nfollowing in your `init.el`. Replace `js2-mode-hook` by `javascript-mode-hook` if you don't use\r\njs2-mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(add-hook 'js2-mode-hook (lambda () (requirejs-mode)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Keybindings\r\n\r\n* `C-c rf` : require-import-file\r\n* `C-c rc` : require-create\r\n* `C-c ra` : require-import-add\r\n\r\n## Functions\r\n\r\n### `require-import-file`\r\n\r\nImporting file as a module is *Backbone aware* in the sense that it will try to keep the\r\nsubfolders of the imported files only if these are below `.../collections/`, `.../views/`,\r\n`.../models/`, `.../templates/`.\r\n\r\nFor example, importing a file with the relative path `../collections/books.js` from a module\r\nwill put `'collections/books'` in the dependencies list and `'Books'` in the function declaration.\r\n\r\nIt will also prepend `text!` in the dependencies list item if the file loaded is a template.\r\n\r\n### `require-import-add`\r\n\r\nThis mode keeps track of all files imported as a dependency within an Emacs session. So\r\na common dependency, such as jquery, underscore, backbone, or any you have already \r\nimported in your session will be available with this function.\r\n\r\nDependencies are stored as an associative list, so choosing an item from the list will\r\nput it's dependency name in the list and it's function variable name in the module's\r\nfunction definition.\r\n\r\nCurrent defaults:\r\n\r\n* `jquery` : `$`\r\n* `underscore` : `_`\r\n* `backbone` : `Backbone`\r\n\r\n### `require-create`\r\n\r\nCreates an empty AMD module.\r\n\r\nExplicitly, generates:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefine (\r\n    [],\r\n    \r\n    function ( ) {\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it is not necessary to create an empty module before importing dependencies\r\nas it will be created by default if it is not present.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nNo dependencies, but it will use `ido` to auto-complete prompts if it is present.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nIf you find bugs or you would like new features to be implemented, use the [issue\r\ntracker](https://github.com/ricardmo/requirejs-mode/issues), or better, make a\r\npull request with the fixes.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 Marc-Olivier Ricard\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
